SAFE_RM

BACKGROUND:
    Do you think the standard 'rm' command in the Linux/Unix/MacOS is so dangerous?
    If your answer is yes, then this substitution is right for you.

PURPOSE:
    This tool will subsitute the systemic rm command, and it will not
    delete your file really. It makes a directory named '.Recycle Bin'
    in /tmp, when you delete file/directory, the script only copy 
    these file to '.Recycle Bin', arranged with directories seperated
    by date.
    My english is not so good, so, if you can`t understand properly,
    just use. Take it easy, this tool is very safe.

USAGE:
    Please add the alias statement to the .bashrc file in user`s home directory.
    alias rm='~/bin/s_rm.sh'
